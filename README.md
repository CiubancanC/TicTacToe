## ✨ Features

- **🤖 Balanced DQN AI**: Learns to play optimally as both X (first) and O (second) player
- **🎯 Perfect Minimax AI**: Unbeatable AI that never loses
- **🏋️ Advanced Training**: Strategic reward shaping with self-play and perspective flipping
- **📊 Performance Analysis**: Comprehensive AI evaluation and comparison tools
- **🎮 Interactive Gameplay**: Play against AI with simple text interface
- **⚔️ AI Battles**: Watch AIs compete against each other

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install torch numpy matplotlib pygame

# Or use requirements file
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

**Interactive Menu:**
```bash
python3 tictactoe.py
```

**Command Line:**
```bash
# Train a new AI (10,000 episodes)
python3 tictactoe.py train --episodes 10000

# Play against the AI
python3 tictactoe.py play

# AI vs AI battle (100 games)
python3 tictactoe.py battle --games 100

# Analyze AI performance vs Minimax
python3 tictactoe.py analyze --games 100
```

## 🧠 AI Architecture

### Balanced DQN Agent
- **Network**: 4-layer deep neural network (256→256→128→9)
- **Training**: Double DQN with prioritized experience replay
- **Innovation**: Perspective flipping to handle both X and O positions
- **Rewards**: Strategic bonuses for center control, forks, blocking, etc.

### Perfect Minimax Agent
- **Algorithm**: Minimax with alpha-beta pruning
- **Performance**: Never loses, always wins when possible
- **Use**: Benchmark for evaluating DQN performance

## 📈 Performance Metrics

**Target Performance vs Perfect Minimax:**
- **Excellent**: 90%+ non-loss rate (draws + wins)
- **Good**: 70%+ non-loss rate
- **Fair**: 50%+ non-loss rate

**Balanced Training Results:**
- Learns to play competently from both positions
- Major improvement in O position play (0% → 48%+ non-loss)
- Unified model handles position switching automatically

## 🎯 Key Innovations

### 1. Balanced Training
- **Problem**: Traditional training only teaches X position
- **Solution**: Alternating positions with perspective flipping
- **Result**: AI can play both X and O effectively

### 2. Strategic Reward Shaping
```python
# Reward bonuses
Center control: +0.5
Corner control: +0.3  
Fork creation: +2.0
Blocking wins: +1.5
Win threats: +1.0
```

### 3. Perspective Flipping
- **Concept**: Flip board state for O player (multiply by -1)
- **Benefit**: Single model handles both positions
- **Innovation**: Unified training approach

## 🎮 Gameplay Interface

### Text-Based Play
```
  0 1 2
0 . . .
1 . X .
2 . . .

Your move (row,col): 1,1
```

### Commands During Play
- Move format: `row,col` (e.g., `1,1` for center)
- Coordinates: 0-2 for rows and columns
- Visual feedback with X, O, and . symbols

## 📊 Analysis Tools

### Performance Analysis
```bash
python3 tictactoe.py analyze --games 200
```
Output:
```
📊 RESULTS:
   As X: W:0 D:45 L:5 (90.0% non-loss)
   As O: W:0 D:40 L:10 (80.0% non-loss)
   Overall: 85.0% non-loss rate
🏆 EXCELLENT: Near-perfect play!
```

### AI Battle Arena
```bash
python3 tictactoe.py battle --games 100
```
- Head-to-head AI competitions
- Performance comparisons
- Statistical analysis

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Custom Training
```python
from tictactoe import train_balanced_ai

# Train with custom parameters
agent = train_balanced_ai(
    num_episodes=15000,
    save_path="custom_ai.pt"
)
```

### Load and Use Models
```python
from tictactoe import BalancedDQNAgent

agent = BalancedDQNAgent(epsilon=0)
agent.load("tictactoe_ai.pt")

# Play as X or O
action = agent.choose_action(state, valid_moves, as_player_x=True)
```

## 🎯 Training Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Random exploration with strategic rewards
2. **Phase 2**: Self-play development  
3. **Phase 3**: Position alternation (X/O balance)
4. **Phase 4**: Experience replay and policy refinement

**Key Parameters:**
- Episodes: 10,000+ for good performance
- Batch size: 128
- Learning rate: 0.0005 with adaptive scheduling
- Epsilon decay: 0.997 (slower exploration decay)

## 📋 Dependencies

- **PyTorch**: Neural network training
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib**: Training visualizations
- **Pygame**: GUI support (optional)
